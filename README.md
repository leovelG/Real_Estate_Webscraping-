# Real_Estate_Webscraping-
This is a job I've done to perform web_scrapping on the webpage Inmuebles24, it returns a series of csv files with the information available of houses either to rent or to sell. 
It contains the following files: 
1. Inmuebles24_webscraper.py :  It's the python program that uses Selenium to perform the webscraping on the pages available. 
2. Reader.py : Reads and combine each of the csv created by the webscraper in one csv data file 
3. Aguascaliente.ipyb : A nootebook of the analisis of the data generated by the webscrapper.
